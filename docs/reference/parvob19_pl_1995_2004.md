A seroprevalence survey testing for parvovirus B19 IgG antibody,
performed on large representative national serum banks in Belgium,
England and Wales, Finland, Italy, and Poland. The sera were collected
between 1995 and 2004 and were obtained from residual sera submitted for
routine laboratory testing.

## Usage

``` r
parvob19_pl_1995_2004
```

## Format

A data frame with 5 variables:

- age:

  Age of individual

- seropositive:
