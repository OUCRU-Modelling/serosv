# VZV serological data from Belgium (Flanders) from 1999-2000 (aggregated)

Age-specific seroprevalence of VZV antibodies, assessed in Flanders
(Belgium) between October 1999 and April 2000. This population was
stratified by age in order to obtain approximately 100 observations per
age group.

## Usage

``` r
vzv_be_1999_2000

age <- vzv_be_1999_2000$age
pos <- vzv_be_1999_2000$pos
tot <- vzv_be_1999_2000$tot
plot(age, pos / tot,
  cex = 0.036 * tot, pch = 19, xlab = "age", ylab = "seroprevalence",
  xlim = c(0, 45), ylim = c(0, 1)
