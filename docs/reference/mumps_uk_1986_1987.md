# Mumps serological data from the UK in 1986 and 1987 (aggregated)

a large survey of prevalence of antibodies to mumps and rubella viruses
in the UK. The survey, covering subjects from 1 to over 65 years of age,
provides information on the prevalence of antibody by age

## Usage

``` r
mumps_uk_1986_1987
```

## Format

A data frame with 3 variables:

- age:

  Midpoint of the age group (e.g. 1.5 = 1-2 years old, 2.5 = 2-3 years

- pos:

    xlim = c(0, 45), ylim = c(0, 1)
