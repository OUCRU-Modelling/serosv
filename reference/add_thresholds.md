# Visualize positive threshold at different dilution factors

Visualize positive threshold at different dilution factors

## Usage

``` r
add_thresholds(dilution_factors, positive_threshold = 0.1, shift_text = 0.15)
```

## Arguments

- dilution_factors:

  dilution factors to be visualized

- positive_threshold:

  titer threshold for sample to be considered positive

- shift_text:

  adjust how much the text is shifted along the x-axis (relative to the
  threshold line)
